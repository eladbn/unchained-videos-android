App to interact with [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) APIs.

### What is Real Debrid :question:

Real Debrid is a service to download files from hosting websites and the torrent network.
Files are downloaded directly on their servers that you can then use for your downloads.
They provide high speeds for a lot of services like Mega and RapidGator without needing 
all their premium accounts, and can also stream media files directly. 
**N.B. Real Debrid is a (cheap) paid service**

### 🎬 **TMDB Integration - Enhanced Movie & TV Experience!** :star2:

**Transform your torrent browsing with rich media information!** This enhanced version now includes seamless integration with [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to provide:

- **🖼️ Movie & TV Show Posters** - Visual identification at a glance
- **⭐ Ratings & Reviews** - TMDB community ratings and scores  
- **📝 Plot Summaries** - Detailed descriptions and overviews
- **🗓️ Release Information** - Years, seasons, and episode details
- **🎭 Genre & Metadata** - Complete movie and TV show information

**✨ How it works:**
1. Search for torrents as usual using the built-in search plugins
2. Tap on any movie or TV show result
3. **Automatically see rich TMDB information** with poster, rating, and description!
4. The app intelligently parses torrent names to match with TMDB content

**📝 Note:** You'll need a free TMDB account and API key (quick 2-minute setup):
1. Create a free account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
2. Request an API key at [TMDB API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
3. Add your API key in Unchained Settings → Search → TMDB API Key

### Developing and Contributing :writing_hand:

Contributions are welcome. You can use the [discussion tab](https://github.com/LivingWithHippos/unchained-android/discussions) to ask for help setting up the project. At the moment at least Android Studio 2021.1.1 is needed to build the project.

The dev branch is the one where the development happens, it gets merged into master when a release is ready.

A debug version is available, it reports automatically any crash information, it can be useful to help me debug errors.

This app is written in Kotlin and uses the following architectures/patterns/libraries:

MVVM architectural pattern, Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, Data Binding for managing ui-data relations, Navigation, Moshi, Retrofit, OkHTTP, Room, Coroutines, Flow, Livedata, Coil

**Enhanced with TMDB Integration:** Retrofit API client for TMDB, intelligent torrent name parsing, repository pattern for data management, and Material Design 3 UI components for rich media display.

The app is available in English, Italian, Spanish and French, ~~you can contribute to those or add a new language [here](https://localization.professiona.li/engage/unchained-for-android/) (much appreciated!)~~ (the service is currently down, you can still contribute by forking the project and adding the strings to the `strings.xml` file in the `values-xx` folders)

#### Search Plugins

[Notice: plugins have been moved to another repository](https://gitlab.com/LivingWithHippos/unchained-plugins)

It's possible to create new plugins with a bit of knowledge of html and regexes. There's also a work in progress [wiki page](https://github.com/LivingWithHippos/unchained-android/wiki/Search-Engine), hopefully there will be more documentation including a video in the future.
